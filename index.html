                That is an originally religious celebration that has become a popular holiday in many countries, especially in the USA and Canada. It is celebrated on the 31st of October, the eve of All Hallows’ Day. The word ‘Halloween’ is a contraction of ‘All Hallows’ Evening’.

Nowadays most people do not see Halloween as a religious celebration. It is just a fun holiday that includes many traditional activities such as trick-or-treating and costume parties. It is popular among both children and grown-ups.

A Halloween costume party is an event where everyone should be dressed up as ghosts, witches, skeletons etc, although in many cases people choose less ghost-related costumes and dress up as pirates, robots, popular shows and videogames characters. Visiting haunted attractions is a different kind of activity. That kind of event is a live show that simulates visiting a haunted house, people might feel like they are in a horror movie. Haunted attractions usually feature scary characters such as horror movie villains or ghosts and zombies.
